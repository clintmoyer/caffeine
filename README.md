# Caffeine

Caffeine is a lightweight macOS menu bar application that prevents your Mac from going to sleep, dimming the screen, or activating the screen saver. Itâ€™s designed to be simple and easy to use, offering quick toggling of sleep prevention directly from the menu bar.

## Features

- Toggle sleep prevention with a single click from the menu bar.
- Visual indicators for active (Caffeine enabled) and inactive states.
- Minimal system resource usage while running.
- Easily quit the application from the menu bar.

## Requirements

- macOS 10.14 or higher.
- Swift 5.0 or higher.
- rsvg-convert (for converting SVG icons to PNG).

## Installation

This will compile the program, package the app, and create the DMG.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/clintmoyer/caffeine.git
cd caffeine
make
```

## How It Works

Caffeine uses the macOS IOKit power management system to create an assertion that prevents the display from sleeping. When Caffeine is active, it creates a `kIOPMAssertionTypeNoDisplaySleep` assertion, which keeps the display on indefinitely. When deactivated, the assertion is released, allowing the system to manage power as usual.

## Usage

- **Left-click** the Caffeine icon in the menu bar to toggle the sleep prevention on and off.
- **Right-click** to access the menu, which includes a "Quit" option to terminate the app.

## Running Tests

To run the unit tests for Caffeine, use the `test` target in the Makefile:

```bash
make test
```

This will compile and run the tests defined in `tests.swift` and ensure that the core functionality (activating, deactivating, and toggling Caffeine) works as expected.
